# ets2-local-radio #

ets2-local-radio allows you to automatically play the radio stations from where you are in ETS2.
Are you in Poland? It'll show Polish radio stations. Are you in France? It'll show French radio stations.
It automatically switches when you are too far away from a station, and it can optionally play static if the station is far away.
(Like those old radios do)

## How does it work? ##

1. Install [ets2-telemetry-server](https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server)
2. Download this skin from the [releases page](https://github.com/Koenvh1/ets2-local-radio/releases)
3. Put the skin in ets2-telemetry-server's skins folder
4. Select it and have fun
