# ETS2 Local Radio #

ETS2 Local Radio plays ready from where you are, in ETS2. Feel the immersion when the Swedish radio plays in Sweden,
and the Polish radio in Poland. It will switch automatically, and allow you to switch stations while driving.

## How does it work? ##

1. Download ETS2 Local Radio from the [releases page](https://github.com/Koenvh1/ets2-local-radio/releases)
2. Extract it wherever you like, and copy the files from plugins to your ETS2 folder (or use plugins.exe in the plugins folder)
3. Execute ETS2 Local Radio server.exe, open ETS2 Local Radio (or go to [http://localhost:8330](http://localhost:8330)) and have fun.

## Troubleshooting: ##
_Can't access it from another device_

Please make sure your firewall is not blocking the connection

_It says the simulator is not running even though it is!_

Please make sure the plugin is installed and working

_ETS2 Local Radio crashes!_
